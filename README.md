# GameMaker-Projects 🕹️

A portfolio of small games and prototypes built using **GameMaker Studio** (GameMaker Language).  
Each folder in this repository contains one project, complete with source files and assets.

## 📂 Project Structure & Rules

### 🎯 Game 01 – Asteroids
- **Rules:** Control a spaceship and destroy drifting asteroids. Avoid collisions!  
- **Controls:**  
  - ⬆️ Arrow – Thrust forward  
  - ⬅️ / ➡️ Arrows – Rotate ship  
  - Space – Shoot bullets  

### 🐤 Game 02 – Flappy Bird

## 🛠 Tech / Tools Used

- **GameMaker Language (GML)**  
- GameMaker Studio IDE  
- Sprite assets, sounds, and custom code

## 📌 Features & Goals

These are small-scale projects intended for learning and experimentation.  
Typical features include:

- Basic game loops (start, play, end)  
- Collision detection  
- Player input (keyboard, mouse, touch)  
- Movement physics (gravity, velocity, wrap-around, etc.)  
- Scoring, lives, UI, and resetting  

Over time, I plan to expand this collection with more complex ideas (platformers, puzzle games, etc.).
